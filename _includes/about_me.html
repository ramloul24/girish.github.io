            I am currently a Technical Project Manager at <a href="https://www.heady.io/about/">Heady</a>, a mobile agency that works with
            Fortune 500 companies. In less than a year working there, I have contributed to several complex, distributed systems like a 
            raffle feature for one of our ecommerce clients, new payment platform integration and support for a wishlist, all of which have
            met the product owners' high expectations. 
        </p>
        <p>
           My current position requires me to collect and analyze requirements from product owners, translate those into technical specifications and
           manage our offshore development team. My day-to-day also consists of code reviews on codebases written primarily in Node JS, Swift and Java.
           Thanks to my previous internships, my time at FullStack Academy of Code and pursuits in personal and academic full stack projects, 
           I am proficient in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node). To reinforce my coding skills, I also contribute to open source projects
           and write for FreeCodeCamp (I believe the best way to learn is to teach). I have also dabbled in other frameworks like PHP Laravel and ASP .NET.
